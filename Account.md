Fields
- accId
	- I assume this is the id in the db
- accName
- accDescription
- [[Currency]]
	- curId
		- currency Id, presumably
	- #field/curCode
		- because curId was not enough
	- #field/curName
		- because id and code is not enough
	- currencyScale
		- this is an #enigma
- bankable: int
	- Shouldn't this be a boolean? I'm assuming it's just 1 or 0
- modifiedByGid
	- presumably, the id of the [[Game|game]] that modified it. But is it the last game that modified it? Makes little sense. 
- [[AccountType]]
	- defaultAccountForCurrency: boolean
		- I suppose this determines whether for a given currency this the account that should be used
		- so there can be more Accounts for the same currency
