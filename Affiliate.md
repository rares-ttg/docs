An affiliate is any external system that receives games from the TTG System. There are two kinds of Affiliates, [[Partner]] and [[Webmaster]]. A partner is any other app which serves games hosted on TTGS. A Webmaster is only an advertiser, i.e. has a banner on his website which links to a Partner site or to TTGS.
