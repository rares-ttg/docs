The class is supposed to hold all profile information for a [[Player]] . In spite of this, it does not reference [[PlayerProfileObj]] because....why would it?
It is mainly an utility class with static methods that return some data in a Hashtable format. 
Information retrieved: 
- [[Player Banking Information]]
