There are some configurations that the legacy code has and it is a question whether they should be included in the #rewrite . The [[Configurations#casino.server.Configuration|Configuration]]  file has the following config entries for logging:
- logging folder;
- max log file size
- number of log file generations
- number of log records buffered
- whether logging should append to the logfile (what is the alternative?)
- the log level
- a mysteryous `memoryHandlerTriggerLevel="SEVERE"`.
- the debug log file 
- logging formatter
- whether to log to the console
- whether the class should appear in logging (isn't it obvious? Why is this even a choice?)
- whether the method name should appear in logging(how exactly are they doing debug without method name?)
- whether timestamps should appear in logging. 
- a map of logging filters
- and the class name, as a String #fml/type-hell, of the logging properties reader.
	- why have another one?
